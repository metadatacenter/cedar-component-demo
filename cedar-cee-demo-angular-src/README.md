# CEDAR Embeddable Editor (CEE) Angular 2 Demo

This demo provides a sample integration of CEE into an Angular 2 application.

# Installation

All the required dependencies, such as javascript libraries, images, and the latest version of the CEE Webcomponent are already packaged with this demo. You can use this demo as a shell for your own Angular application or as a reference on how to embed and configure the CEE Webcomponent in your own Angular environment.

## Clone the repository

Clone this repository onto a local directory of your choice:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-cee-demo-angular.git
```

## Configure the project

Open the file `cedar-cee-demo-angular/assets/data/appConfig.json` in your favorite text editor or IDE and edit configuration parameters based on the instructions below.

## Configure endpoints (optional)

### Metadata save endpoint

CEE offers the functionality to save user metadata using a custom remote endpoint. If you plan to enable this feature, you will need to change the following configuration parameters in your `cee-config.json`:

```json
"showDataSaver": true,
"dataSaverEndpointUrl": "http://localhost:8000/datasave.php",
```
Replace `dataSaverEndpointUrl` with a URL pointing to the endpoint that will handle metadata submissions.

### Template upload endpoint

CEDAR Embeddable Editor includes an optional feature that allows uploading a template source file and creating metadata for that template.

If you plan to enable that functionality, you will need to confgigure two endpoints in your `cee-config.json`:

```json
"showTemplateUpload": true,
"templateUploadBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8000",
"templateUploadEndpoint": "/upload.php",
"templateDownloadEndpoint": "/download.php",
```
Replace `templateUploadBaseUrl` with a URL pointing to the root of the server on which the endpoints reside. Configure `templateUploadEndpoint` and `templateDownloadEndpoint` to their respective paths from the `templateUploadBaseUrl`.

For a more complete description of these endpoints as well as other optional configuration parameters, please refer to the [**Configuration**](https://github.com/metadatacenter/cedar-embeddable-editor#configuration) section of CEE documentation:

# Start server and navigate to the demo app in browser

Start the Angular server by running this following command:

```shell
cedar-cee-demo-angular$ ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/index.html`.

If the installation completed successfully, the CEDAR Embeddable error should load without errors.
